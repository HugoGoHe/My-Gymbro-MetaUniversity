# My Gymbro


**My Gymbro** is an app that helps the user track their progress on their weight lifting journey.

    • Integrated the HighCharts API to create charts of the user’s data, such as body weight change over time
    and weight progression in certain exercise.

    • Integrated Parse and Back4App to store the data in the backend.

    • Used logarithmic regression to obtain and plot a prediction of the weight that the user will be able to lift in the
    future for a certain exercise
